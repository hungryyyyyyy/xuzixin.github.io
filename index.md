# Bio

Here is **Zixin XU (徐紫馨)**.

I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Data Science** at City University of Hong Kong. Currently, I work as a part-time technical assistant in the TIDES-LAB, advised by [Prof. Jizhou LI]([Welcome to Jizhou’s Homepage — Jizhou Li](http://jizhou.li/index.html)).  

I am interested in designing and implementing advanced deep learning strategies for image processing, such as object recovery from X-ray coherent diffraction patterns. I am also interested in applications and improvements of Implicit Neural Representation.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me.
